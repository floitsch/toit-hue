Good way to get started:
- get the IP of your bridge. You can just visit https://discovery.meethue.com/
  It will list the known IPs for this public IP.

---------- OLD V1 --------------
- visit <ip>/debug/clip.html, which allows to send API requests through the
  browser.
- Start by getting a username:
  ```
  /api
  { "devicetype": "some-name" }
  POST
  ```
  This should fail initially, because you need to press the button on the
    bridge. Once you do that, you can try again and it should work.

- Now you can try to get the list of lights:
    ```
    /api/<username>/lights
    GET
    ```
    This should return a list of lights, with their names and IDs.

---------- NEW V2 --------------
As for v1 get a new user name.
This will eventually be replaced with an actual application key (I think).

v2 is https only.
v2 sends the key as header: hue-application-key

Example:
- URL: /clip/v2/resource/light
- Headers:
  - hue-application-key: <username>

-> GET.

My username:
